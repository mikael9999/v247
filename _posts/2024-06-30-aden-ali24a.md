title: 'Majority-of-Three: The Simplest Optimal Learner?'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Developing an optimal PAC learning algorithm in the realizable setting,
  where empirical risk minimization (ERM) is suboptimal, was a major open problem
  in learning theory for decades. The problem was finally resolved by Hanneke a few
  years ago. Unfortunately, Hanneke’s algorithm is quite complex as it returns the
  majority vote of many ERM classifiers that are trained on carefully selected subsets
  of the data. It is thus a natural goal to determine the simplest algorithm that
  is optimal. In this work we study the arguably simplest algorithm that could be
  optimal:  returning the majority vote of three ERM classifiers. We show that this
  algorithm achieves the optimal in-expectation bound on its error which is provably
  unattainable by a single ERM classifier.  Furthermore, we prove a near-optimal high-probability
  bound on this algorithm’s error.  We conjecture that a better analysis will prove
  that this algorithm is in fact optimal in the high-probability regime.'
